            Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov (Russian: Хабиб Абдулманапович
            Нурмагомедов; Avar: ХIабиб ГӀабдулманапил НурмухӀамадов; born
            September 20, 1988) is a Russian professional mixed martial artist
            of Avar ethnicity. Nurmagomedov is a two-time Combat Sambo World
            Champion and the reigning undisputed UFC Lightweight Champion. He
            currently holds the longest undefeated streak in MMA, with 27 wins,
            and remains undefeated in professional MMA. Hailing from Russia's
            Dagestan region, he is the first Russian and the first Muslim to win
            a UFC title. His headline bout with Conor McGregor at UFC 229 drew
            2.4 million pay-per-view buys, the most ever for an MMA event. As of
            January 2, 2019, he is #3 in official UFC pound-for-pound rankings.

          <h2>Early Career</h2>
          <hr class="separator" />
          <p class="body-text">
            Khabib Nurmagomedov made his professional MMA debut in September
            2008 and compiled four wins in under a month. On October 11,
            Nurmagomedov became the inaugural Atrium Cup tournament champion,
            having defeated his three opponents at the Moscow event. Over the
            next three years he would go undefeated, finishing 11 out of 12
            opponents. These included a first round armbar finish of future
            Bellator title challenger Shahbulat Shamhalaev, which marked his M-1
            Global debut. In 2011, he would go on to compete for the ProFC
            promotion. That year alone he competed in seven fights, all of which
            he won by TKO or submission. A perfect 16-0 record in the regional
            circuits of Russia and Ukraine was enough to get a call up from the
            UFC.
